### Stats
The Stats module provides comprehensive player-versus-player (PvP) performance tracking. It records various metrics related to kills and deaths, offering players insights into their combat history. A key feature is the leaderboard GUI, which allows players to view and sort server-wide statistics.

**Tracked Statistics:**
*   **Kills:** Total number of players eliminated.
*   **Deaths:** Total number of times the player has been eliminated.
*   **Killstreak:**
    *   Current: Number of consecutive kills without dying.
    *   Highest: The player's best recorded killstreak.
*   **Nemesis:** The player who has eliminated this player the most.
*   **Victim:** The player whom this player has eliminated the most.
*   **Favourite Weapon:** The weapon most frequently used to secure kills.
*   **Furthest Kill:** The longest distance from which a kill was achieved.

**Mod Integration:**
*   **Ars Nouveau:** If [Ars Nouveau](https://modrinth.com/mod/ars-nouveau) is present, an additional statistic is tracked:
    *   **Favourite Spell:** The spell most frequently used for kills, including a display of its constituent glyphs.

**Commands:**
The leaderboard GUI can be accessed using the following commands. Detailed kill and death information is available within the GUI, presented in a paginated format.
*   `/cs`

*   `/stats`
    *   **Description (all aliases):** Opens the combat statistics leaderboard GUI.

#### Commands
The following commands are available for managing kits:
*   `/kits`
    *   **Description:** Opens the Kits GUI, allowing players to browse and select from their saved kits.
*   `/kits save <name>`
    *   **Description:** Saves the player's current inventory and equipped armor as a new kit.
    *   **Arguments:**
        *   `<name>`: The desired name for the new kit.
*   `/kits delete <name>`
    *   **Description:** Deletes a previously saved kit.
    *   **Arguments:**
